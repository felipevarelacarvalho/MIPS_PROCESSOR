Version fa2020.1

Release Notes:

1. Improved error policies
    Students shouldn't see python exceptions in the console. Instead they should see a
    a message telling them the error has been logged to temp/errors.log and to post to
    Canvas with any bugs.

2. Can keep waveform open while running
    .wlf files can now remain open in ModelSim while the framework is running, to reload
    the log go to file->datadets->reload

3. Handle Mars errors more gracefully
    The Mars dump is now scanned ahead of time to find Sim-time errors (like unaligned
    address) early on in the framework's execution.

4. Better validation at the start of runs
    The test framework checks if tb_SimplifiedMIPSProcessor.vhd has been modified and
    prints a warning if it has been modified. The simulation framework checks if quartus
    is installed before trying to  run. 

5. Looser comparison
    the dump comparison now ignores any writes to $zero. Allowing students more flexibility
    for multicycle processors.
